## Why should we choose you?
I am a hard worker who is willing to learn what I do not know, which is a lot when it comes to coding, and
your environment has a major influence on how you grow, so i am thinking that if I put my self in an environment
that pushes me to become better will be good for me

## What are your goals for the next six months? How will you accomplish them?
My goal is to improve enough so that I have the skills to be at least considered average,
which I feel is a good starting of point, I will achieve this by being consistent with my work and doing it everyday

## How will you contribute back to the club?
I am willing to do anything for the club, from manual labor to staying back extra hours to do more work,
I just need a place to belong and a purpose
